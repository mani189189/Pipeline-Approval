Option 1: Use existing Jenkins Feature
Click Customize your jenkins job
Build Triggers > Build after other Projects are built.
you can mention which projects needs to be watched and you have multiple options such as

Trigger only if the build is stable
Trigger even if the build is not stable
Trigger even if the build fails
This avoids multiple dependent projects not to be triggered if you select option 1


Option 2: Parameterized Trigger Plugin 
Create a wrapper job for your sequential jobs
For each sequential job
Select Build->Add build step->Trigger/call builds on other projects
Enter the sequential job name
Check the ‘Block until the triggered projects finish their builds’ checkbox (this only appears when you have the Parameterized Trigger Plugin installed)
Now when you run the wrapper job, all the triggered jobs will be run in order and sequentially. You of course also have the option of using the parameters functionality of the plugin too



Option 3: Build Pipeline Plugin
Gives the ability to form a chain of jobs based on their upstream\downstream dependencies. Downstream jobs may, as per the default behaviours, be triggered automatically ,or by a suitable authorised user manually triggering it.



Option 4: Downstream –Ext Plugin
This plugin supports extended configuration for triggering downstream builds:

trigger build only if downstream job has SCM changes
trigger build if upstream build result is better/equal/worse than any given result (SUCCESS, UNSTABLE, FAILURE, ABORTED)
for Matrix (alias multi-configuration) jobs you can decide which part of the job should trigger the downstream job: parent only, configurations only or both
